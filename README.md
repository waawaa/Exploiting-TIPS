# Windbg-TIPS

Break with conditions in a while loop, for example:
<br />
```
counter = 0
while (eax!='\0')
{
  ebx[counter] = ecx[counter]
  counter +=1 //We want to break when counter > 200
}
```

<br /> Break with pseudoregisters:
<br /> <em><strong>bp 00411a6a "r @$t0 = @$t0 + 1; .if (@$t0 < 0n200) {gc} .else {.printf \"Reached\"; .echo }"</strong></em>

 <h1>Crazy Idea </h1>
<br />Do a ROP that instead of call VirtualAlloc would register a new SEH in the application, and when an exception is generated it redirects the flow to a handler, that really is our shellcode, which is registrated as a new handler</em></strong>

  
  <h1>Iterate Linked List</h1>
  
  <br /><em><strong>!list -x ".if (poi(@$extret+0x28) != 0) { u poi(@$extret+0x28); }" (poi(nt!PsProcessType)+0xc8)</strong></em>
  <br />Really this is going to do the following:
  <br />1. The linked list starts at poi(nt!PsProcessType)+0xc8) in this case
  <br />2. We get the position of the linked list (FLINKG)+0x28 and check if it's equal to 0
  <br />3. In case it's different to 0 we disassemble it
